## Slide 3: The 5-Step Methodology
**Title:** Industry Standard CI/CD Methodology

**Introduction:**
"Popular CI/CD tools include Jenkins, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI, and Azure DevOps. These tools can trigger testing scripts every time code is pushed to a repository."

**The 5 Steps We Implemented:**
1. ✅ **Choose CI/CD Tool** - Selected GitHub Actions
2. ✅ **Write Automated Test Scripts** - 19 comprehensive tests
3. ✅ **Configure the Pipeline** - Multi-stage automation
4. ✅ **Monitor Test Results** - Real-time reporting and analytics
5. ✅ **Failure Handling and Feedback** - Notifications and quality gates

**Key Point:** "We followed this exact methodology from our textbook to build a production-ready system"

## Slide 4: Step 1 - Choose CI/CD Tool
**Title:** Step 1: Tool Selection - GitHub Actions

**Why GitHub Actions?**
• **Free and Integrated** - No additional setup required
• **Industry Standard** - Used by Microsoft, Google, millions of developers
• **Extensive Marketplace** - 10,000+ pre-built actions available
• **Native GitHub Integration** - Seamless with version control

**Alternatives We Considered:**
• **Jenkins** - Powerful but complex setup and maintenance
• **GitLab CI** - Excellent but requires GitLab ecosystem
• **CircleCI** - Good performance but limited free tier
• **Travis CI** - Historic choice but less active development
• **Azure DevOps** - Microsoft-focused, enterprise-oriented

**Result:** GitHub Actions chosen for optimal balance of power, simplicity, and cost

## Slide 5: Step 2 - Write Automated Test Scripts
**Title:** Step 2: Comprehensive Testing Implementation

**Testing Framework Selection:**
• **Backend Testing:** Jest + Supertest (Node.js equivalent of JUnit)
• **Frontend Testing:** Jest + JSDOM (JavaScript equivalent of Selenium)
• **Coverage Enforcement:** 80%+ threshold requirement
• **Test Environment:** Automated setup and teardown

**Our Test Suite (19 Total Tests):**
• **Backend API Tests (8 tests):**
  - Health check endpoints
  - Events CRUD operations
